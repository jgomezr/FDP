        explanation="If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared in one language should also be translated in all other languages.

If the string should *not* be translated, you can add the attribute `translatable=&quot;false&quot;` on the `&lt;string>` element, or you can define all your non-translatable strings in a resource file called `donottranslate.xml`. Or, you can ignore the issue with a `tools:ignore=&quot;MissingTranslation&quot;` attribute.

By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS`.

You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in your `res/values/` folder by specifying `tools:locale=&quot;languageCode&quot;` for the root `&lt;resources>` element in your resource file. (The `tools` prefix refers to the namespace declaration `http://schemas.android.com/tools`.)"

        explanation="If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared in one language should also be translated in all other languages.

If the string should *not* be translated, you can add the attribute `translatable=&quot;false&quot;` on the `&lt;string>` element, or you can define all your non-translatable strings in a resource file called `donottranslate.xml`. Or, you can ignore the issue with a `tools:ignore=&quot;MissingTranslation&quot;` attribute.

By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS`.

You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in your `res/values/` folder by specifying `tools:locale=&quot;languageCode&quot;` for the root `&lt;resources>` element in your resource file. (The `tools` prefix refers to the namespace declaration `http://schemas.android.com/tools`.)"
